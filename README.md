e-CAMP: expanding-constrained alternating minimization for parameter mapping.

Aimed at utilizing massive clinical MR image, this work generates the underlying T2 map from the clinical TSE (Turbo Spin Echo) protocol that has a band-sampling pattern and a long echo train, which is challgening for state-of-the-art T2 map reconstruction methods.

The idea is not limited to producing T2 map but can be expanded to other parameter mapping.
