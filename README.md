e-CAMP: expanding-constrained alternating minimization for parameter mapping.

Aimed at utilizing massive clinical MR images, this work generates the underlying T2 map from the T2-weighted image of clinical TSE (Turbo Spin Echo) protocols with band-sampling patterns and long echo trains, which is challenging for state-of-the-art T2 map reconstruction methods.

The idea is not limited to producing T2 maps but can be expanded to other parameter mapping.
